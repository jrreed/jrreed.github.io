description: In 2010 I co-created an Android course for Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with my thesis advisor, Dr. David 
             Janzen, as my Computer Science masters degree thesis project. We received a Google grant that included 30
             Android phones to use for the class. The class was for upper division Software Engineering students with 
             lectures focusing on the nuances of mobile development and entrepreneurship in general which were taught by
             David Janzen. In addition to the lectures the students were taught how to develop Android apps through a 
             series of laboratory assignments and tutorials which I designed and wrote.
