description: This is the app lets users search for musicians in Spotify, see their top songs, and listen to 30-second previews. It makes use of the Spotify API for all of its data and audio streams. For phones the app makes use of three separate activities that flow from one to the next. For tablets the app combines a Master Detail Flow with a Dialog Fragment to achieve the same functionality as the phone. The player allows the user to start and stop playback of a 30-second preview of the song, skip to the next or previous song in the Top Songs list, and provides a scrub-bar to let the user scrub the playback position.
